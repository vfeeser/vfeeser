Hello! I'm Victoria, a junior data analyst with skills in business analytics, data visualization, and other tools like SQL, Tableau, and PowerBI. 

Currently, I am working on analysis reports to clients to help the focus team create data-driven decisions on behalf of our clients. In my case, the clients I am serving are the special education students in my area. Since 2022, I have been growing my analyst skills utilizing different education programs available to me. In 2022, I completed the Google Data Analytics program where I was able to learn about data cleaning, making data-driven decisions, SQL, the basics of R programming, and also using visualization tools such as Tableau. Later, I was also able to complete a PowerBI certification with Los Positas College here in Livermore, CA. In October 2024, I enrolled in the 4-month TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics program where I have been able to deepen my skills in data visualization, working with large datasets, and crafting the story that I would like to tell when analysing data. 

In December 2024, I also had the opportunity to participate in an analyst competition where we were given multiple datasets from which to choose from. These datasets led us to a potential problem for us to clean the data, create visualizations, and present our findings live to a group of judges and audience members. This taught me some valuable lessons in working with a team to solve a problem and address the needs of our potential "clients." This project and others are featured in my repositories. 

Other fun facts about me:
- I love to read books in my spare time. Preferably, I like lighthearted fiction or fantasy novels.
- I have a tri-color Corgi, two cats, and freshwater fish.
- I am somewhat a jack-of-all-trades: I enjoy playing multiple instruments, gaming, and crafting.
- I am always interested in learning something new.
